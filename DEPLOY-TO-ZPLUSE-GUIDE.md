### Step 1: Access Your GoDaddy Hosting Control Panel

1. **Login to GoDaddy:**
   - Go to [godaddy.com](https://godaddy.com)
   - Click "Sign In" (top right)
   - Enter your GoDaddy account credentials

2. **Access Your Hosting:**

   - Click "Manage" next to your hosting plan

3. **Open File Manager:**
   - Look for "File Manager" or "cPanel" button
   - Click to open it

### Step 2: Upload Your Website Files

1. **Navigate to public_html:**
   - In File Manager, open the `public_html` folder
   - This is where your website files go

2. **Upload Files:**
   - Click "Upload" or drag and drop
   - Upload ALL files from your `c:\z+\godaddy-upload\` folder:

**Main Files to Upload:**
```
✅ index.html (homepage)
✅ style.css (main styling)
✅ about.html
✅ contact.html
✅ client.html
✅ All other .html files (agriculture.html, culture.html, etc.)
✅ asset/ folder (contains your logos and images)
✅ employee-dashboard/ folder
```

3. **Verify Upload:**
   - Make sure all files are in `public_html/`
   - Check that `asset/` and `employee-dashboard/` folders are complete

### Step 3: Configure Domain Settings

1. **Check Domain Connection:**
   - In GoDaddy, go to "My Products" → "Domains"
   - Find zpluse.com
   - Click "Manage"

2. **DNS Settings:**
   - Go to "DNS" tab
   - Ensure these records exist:
     - **A Record**: `@` points to your hosting server
     - **CNAME**: `www` points to `zpluse.com`
   - (These should be automatic if domain and hosting are from same GoDaddy account)

### Step 4: Test Your Website

1. **Visit Your Website:**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Website Doesn't Load:

2. **Clear browser cache** - Ctrl+F5 to force refresh
3. **Check File Manager** - Ensure files are in `public_html/` not in subfolders

### If Images Don't Load:
1. **Check asset folder** - Should be `public_html/asset/`
2. **Verify file names** - Check for correct capitalization
3. **Check file permissions** - Should be 644 for files, 755 for folders

### If Some Pages Don't Work:
1. **Check file extensions** - All should be `.html`
