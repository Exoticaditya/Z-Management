   - This works similar to web hosting

4. **Email Only**
   - Look for "Email & Office" 
   - This doesn't include web hosting

If you only bought the domain, you'll need hosting:

1. **Go to GoDaddy.com**
2. **Click "Hosting" in top menu**
3. **Choose "Web Hosting"**
4. **Select cheapest plan** (Economy ~$2.99/month)
