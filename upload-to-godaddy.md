# 📤 Upload Your Z+ Website to GoDaddy Hosting

## Step-by-Step Upload Process

### 1. Access cPanel (GoDaddy File Manager)
- Login to your GoDaddy account
- Go to "My Products" → "Web Hosting" 
- Click "Manage" next to your hosting plan
- Open "File Manager" or "cPanel"

### 2. Files to Upload (Static Version)
Upload these files to the `public_html` folder:

**Main Website Files:**
- `index.html` (main homepage)
- `style.css` (main stylesheet)
- `about.html`
- `contact.html`
- `client.html`
- All other `.html` files in root directory

**Assets Folder:**
- `asset/` folder (contains logos and images)
  - `company_logo5.png`
  - `company-logo.jpg`
  - `recovery.html`

**Employee Dashboard:**
- `employee-dashboard/index.html`

### 3. Domain Configuration
- In GoDaddy Domain settings, point `zpluse.com` to your hosting
- This should be automatic if you bought hosting with the domain

### 4. Test Your Website
- Visit `https://zpluse.com` 
- Check all pages load correctly
- Verify images and styling work

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Remove Backend Dependencies
Since this is static hosting, remove these references:
1. Any Java/Spring Boot API calls
2. Database connections  
3. Dynamic server-side features

### Make It Work Without Backend
- Contact forms → Use GoDaddy's form builder or Formspree
- User authentication → Remove or use third-party service
- Dynamic content → Convert to static content
