## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Z+ Management Platform team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security issues you find.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by emailing: **security@zplus.com** (replace with your actual security contact)

Include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on severity

### Security Update Process

1. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its impact
2. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
3. **Release**: We will release a security update
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure with the reporter

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Sanitize data before output

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
   - Apply principle of least privilege

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper session management

4. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security events appropriately
   - Implement rate limiting

### For Deployments

1. **Environment Security**
   ```bash
   # Use strong passwords
   DB_PASSWORD=complex_password_with_symbols_123!
   
   # Generate strong JWT secrets
   JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
   
   # Enable HTTPS
   SSL_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **Database Security**
   - Use dedicated database user with minimal privileges
   - Enable SSL connections
   - Regular security updates

3. **Network Security**
   - Use firewalls to restrict access
   - Enable CORS only for trusted origins
   - Implement rate limiting

### Configuration Security

#### Database Configuration
```yaml
# Secure database configuration
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/zplus?ssl=true&sslmode=require
    username: ${DB_USERNAME}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
  jpa:
    show-sql: false  # Never show SQL in production
    properties:
      hibernate:
        format_sql: false
```

#### Security Headers
```yaml
# Enable security headers
server:
  servlet:
    session:
      cookie:
        secure: true
        http-only: true
        same-site: strict
```

#### JWT Configuration
```java
// Secure JWT configuration
@Value("${jwt.secret}")
private String jwtSecret;

@Value("${jwt.expiration:86400000}") // 24 hours
private Long jwtExpiration;

// Use strong algorithms
private static final String ALGORITHM = "HS512";
```

## Security Features

### Authentication
- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control** (ADMIN, EMPLOYEE, CLIENT)
- **Password hashing** using BCrypt with configurable rounds
- **Session management** with secure cookies

### Authorization
- **Method-level security** with Spring Security annotations
- **URL-based access control** for different user roles
- **Resource-level permissions** for data access

### Data Protection
- **Password encryption** using BCrypt
- **Sensitive data masking** in logs
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **SQL injection prevention** through JPA/Hibernate

### Communication Security
- **HTTPS support** with configurable SSL
- **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests
- **Security headers** for XSS and CSRF protection

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run security tests
mvn test -Dtest=SecurityTest

# OWASP dependency check
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check

# Static analysis
mvn spotbugs:check
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Authentication bypass attempts**
- [ ] **Authorization escalation tests**
- [ ] **SQL injection testing**
- [ ] **XSS vulnerability testing**

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Workflow

1. **Detection** - Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment** - Determine impact and scope
3. **Containment** - Limit further damage
4. **Eradication** - Remove the threat
5. **Recovery** - Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned** - Improve security measures
